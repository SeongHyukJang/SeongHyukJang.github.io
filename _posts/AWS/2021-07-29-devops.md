introduction to devops
- What is DevOps?
    - combination of cultural philoshphies, paractices, and tools
    - increase an organizations's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity
    - faster than using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes
    - Dev : Devlopment
        - processes that create software
        - change things quickly
        - release often
    - Ops : Operation
        - processes that deliver and monitor the software
        - maintain stability of the application
        - frequent release -> stability X
    - optimize the productivity of Dev & reliability of Ops
- Problems with Traditional Development Practices
    - slow & inefficient
    - fail to support teams' efforts to quickly deliver stable, high-quality application
    - Waterfall Devlopment, Monolithic application, Manual Processes, Siloed team structure
    - cause bottleneck and delay

- Why DevOps?
    - Proven Success (성공적으로 증명되었다)
    - The benefits of DevOps
        - agility
        - rapid delivery
        - reliability
        - scale
        - improved collaboration
        - security

- DevOps Culture
    - culture of transparency, effective and seamless collaboration, and common goals
    - 7 core principles (that can help you achieve a DevOps culture)
        - Create a highly collaborative environment
            - break down silos, align goals, and deliver on common objectives
        - Automate when possible
            - repeatable tasks are automated
            - IaC
        - Focus on customer needs
            - with feedback loops, DevOps teams stay in-touch with their cutomer and develop software
        - Develop small and release often
            - give teams the agility they need to be responsive to customer needs and business objectives
        - Include security at every phase
            - can identify and resolve potential vulnerabilities before they become major issues
        - Continuously experiment and learn
            - teams are innovative. with innovation, failure will happen. failure is a learning opportunity
        - Continuously improve
            - work toward common goals and continuous improvement

- DevOps Practices
    - Communication and collaboration
        - DevOps teams set strong cultura norms around transparency of information and communication
    - Monitoring and observability
        - used to assess how effective changes to the application and infrastructure are
    - Continuous Integration
        - merge code changes into a central repository
    - Continuous Delivery/Condinuous Deployment
        - every code change is automatically built, tested, and then deployed
    - Microservices architecture
        - design approach that builds an application as a set of loosely coupled services
    - Infrastructure as Code
        - infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code

- Devops pipeline
    - code -> build -> test -> release -> deploy -> monitor
    - Continuous Integration ~ |
    - Continuous Delivery ~       |     | Continuous Delivery ~
    - Continuous Deployment ~                              |

- DevOps Tools
    - AWS's DevOps tools integrate with other third-party tools (Github, Jenkins...)
    - Cloud
        - Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, team provision envrionments on demand, using cloud providers like AWS
    - Development
        - tools that help teams develop and deliver faster
        - IDEs : AWS Cloud9, IntelliJ, Eclipse, Vistual Studio Code
        - SDKs : AWS SDK for Java, iPhone SDK
        - Source code repositories : GitHub, AWS CodeCommit
    - CI/CD
        - tools automate continuously integrated code that teams develop, check compliance with standards, run testing more frequently
        - Build tools : Jenkins, Travis CI, AWS CodeBuild
        - Source control tools, repositories : Git, AWS CodeCommit
        - Deployment tools : AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CloudFormation
        - Pipeline automation tools : AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitLab
    - Infrastructure automation
        - programmatically define you infra including constraints
        - Infrastructure automation tools : AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, AWS Elastic Beanstalk
        - Configuration management tools : Chef, Puppet, AWS OpsWorks
    - Containers and Serverless
        - developers can focus on application and not on the details of the host environment
        - Serverless services : AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate
        - Container Services
            - Runtimes : Docker, Containered
            - Orchestration : Amazon ECS, Kubernetes, Amazon EKS
    - Monitoring and Observability
        - help you be proactive in preventing challenges before they occur
        - Examples : AWS X-Ray, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail
